How to run project:
run main.py file (type 'python main.py')

Project background:
This was a school assignment for Data Structures and Algorithms 2. The goal is deliver 40 packages on trucks with a time constraint and mileage constraint(140 miles). 
To view 

Algorith background:
To accomplish this task I used a greedy algorithm which chose the next node by comparing it to the truck's current location.
